<b>STACK IMPLEMENTATION</b>

<b>CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION:</b>
	Write a program which implements a stack interface for integers. The interface should have "push" and "pop" functions. Your task is to "push" a series of integers and then "pop" and print every alternate integer.

<b>INPUT SAMPLE:</b>
    Your program should accept a file as its first argument. The file contains a series of space delimited integers, one per line.

    For example:
    1 2 3 4
    10 -2 3 4

<b>OUTPUT SAMPLE:</b>
    Print to stdout every alternate space delimited integer, one per line.

    For example:
    4 2
    4 -2
